## Test Plan 

1. **Synthesis of Nanomaterials :**
   - MXene nanomaterials are synthesized in tubukar furnace with nitrogen gas
   - MoS2 nanomaterials are synthesized by taking Molybdenum disulphide and Thiourea in calculated amounts and are kept in autoclave.
   - MoS2 is also grown on paper by adding a small sheet of paper in the solution before keeping it in the autoclave.
    
2. **Device Fabrication :**
   - A device is designed for sensor using a glass slide.
   - A small piece of MoS2 substrate is fixated to the glass slide using silver paste along with connecting wires.
       
3. **Priliminary Testing :**
   - Testing of the MoS2 is done by connecting the device to Source Meter Unit.
   - A drop of creatinine is added to the substrate and the changes in the current voltage characteristics are noted.
     
     

## Installation & Usage
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Assemble the sensor components on a flexible substrate.
   - Connect the FET sensor to the microcontroller.
   - Configure the wireless module for communication.
   
2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install the required libraries for the MCU.
   - Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
   - Use a mobile app or web dashboard to view real-time data.

3. **Testing & Calibration:**
   - Test with known creatinine concentrations.
   - Calibrate the sensor for accuracy.
