# Wearable FET-Based Sensor for Creatinine Detection in Sweat Samples

## Overview
This project focuses on developing a **wearable field-effect transistor (FET)-based sensor** for detecting **creatinine** in sweat samples. The goal is to create a non-invasive and real-time monitoring system for kidney health assessment.

## Features
- **Real-time detection** of creatinine in sweat.
- **Wearable and lightweight** design for continuous monitoring.
- **High sensitivity and selectivity** using advanced FET technology.
- **Wireless communication** for data transmission to mobile or cloud platforms.

## Components Used
- **Field-Effect Transistor (FET) Sensor**
- **Biorecognition Element** (for creatinine selectivity)
- **Microcontroller Unit (MCU)** (e.g., ESP32, Arduino, or Raspberry Pi)
- **Flexible Substrate** for wearable integration
- **Bluetooth/Wi-Fi Module** for wireless data transfer

## Working Principle
1. **Sweat Collection:** The sensor collects sweat passively through a hydrophilic membrane.
2. **FET-Based Sensing:** The FET detects changes in electrical signals due to the presence of creatinine.
3. **Signal Processing:** The microcontroller processes the data and transmits it wirelessly.
4. **Data Visualization:** The readings are displayed on a smartphone or cloud dashboard.

## Installation & Usage
1. **Hardware Setup:**
   - Assemble the sensor components on a flexible substrate.
   - Connect the FET sensor to the microcontroller.
   - Configure the wireless module for communication.
   
2. **Software Setup:**
   - Install the required libraries for the MCU.
   - Upload the firmware to the microcontroller.
   - Use a mobile app or web dashboard to view real-time data.

3. **Testing & Calibration:**
   - Test with known creatinine concentrations.
   - Calibrate the sensor for accuracy.
